MVP:
- A website that lets me count my words, gives me prompts, does spell check, lets me download in different formats,
- All settings fold up so they aren't seen
- Default is a big, white screen

Big
- Database
- User logins
-

Medium
- Font switching
- Language switching
- Spelling/Grammar checking
- Prompts

Little:
- Make everything line-up right
- Make a logo
- I'm scared of white space, fill this with text so I only have a little bit of room to write
